description: Turn the current conversation into a spec at ./specs/<feature>.md — no interview, just synthesis of what you've already discussed.

This skill takes the current conversation context and codebase understanding and produces a spec. Do NOT interview the user — just synthesize what you already know.

## Process

1. Explore the repo to understand the current state of the codebase, if you haven't already.

2. Sketch out the seams at which you're going to test the feature. Existing seams should be preferred to new ones. Use the highest seam possible. If new seams are needed, propose them at the highest point you can. The fewer seams across the codebase, the better — the ideal number is one.

   Check with the user that these seams match their expectations.

3. Write the spec using the spec template from the `create-spec` skill, then save it to `./specs/<feature>.md` (create `./specs/` if needed).
